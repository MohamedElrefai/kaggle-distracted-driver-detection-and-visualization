# kaggle-distracted-driver-detection-and-visualization
In this repo we will implement a classifier to classify the distracted driver detection with pre-trained VGG16 and pre-trained ResNet50 and adding ensemble model for increasing the accuracy and we will interest in visualization of what the network learning  in VGG-16 pre-trained model by Grad-CAM algorithm.
